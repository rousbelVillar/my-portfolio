        I'm a software developer specializing in full-stack web development;
        however, my experience has leaned more toward front-end development. I
        enjoy delivering clean, simple, yet robust software that stands the test
        of time, while also creating beautiful, high-quality websites that are
        accessible and easy to use.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Currently, I work as a Senior Front-End Engineer at New Fire Global
        Partners, supporting a managed care and healthcare solutions
        organization. I contribute to four UI projects, ensuring that components
        and features meet quality, accessibility, and user experience standards.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the past, I’ve had the opportunity to work with a variety of large
        corporations and outsourcing partners across industries such as
        healthcare, communications, and learning aid software.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my spare time, I enjoy surfing, snowboarding, playing video games,
        hiking, and traveling with my wife.
